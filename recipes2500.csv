i've used black beans instead of kidney beans, and once made this with azuki beans and brown glutinous rice, all with equal success.  

using a small metal bowl covered with aluminum foil inside your pressure cooker is recommended to prevent the foam that is produced by the cooking rice and beans from blocking the vent tube, which could be very, very bad.  if you're tempted to forgo this saftey precaution, i urge you to check your owner's manual for recommendations on cooking rice and beans.  me, i'm lazy, and like having the bowl with its foil cover ready for storing leftovers.","['dried red kidney beans', 'brown rice', 'water']",3,2.75,4,no soak pressure cooker rice and beans 126743

to protect their top secret recipe, kfc has portions of the secret blend of herbs premixed at two confidential spice companies. after that, the blend is distributed to the kfc's offices located at different, where they are finally combined for use. there is one more point to note, kfc uses pressure cookers to fry their chicken pieces so unless you have a way of pressure frying at home, it will be quite difficult for you to duplicate kfc chicken recipe. 

if you want to fry super crusty and crispy chicken like kfc, you need to dip your chicken pieces in egg, then flour, then egg then flour coating. after that, you need to fry it in a pressure cooker so that you will get the exact same crusty and crispy taste to your fried chicken which kfc is so eager to protect at all cost. before you proceed further it is advisable to go through the article kfc secret recipe to know about the secret mix of the herbs used by kfc to derive that special taste. 
method 
you have to put all the ingredients mentioned above in a blender and blend it for 3 to 4 minutes barring flour, eggs and milk. 
next, combine the eggs and milk and beat it to a smooth consistency after that add the previously blended herbs and work out a homogeneous mixture. and take the flour on a baking paper sheet. 

now, dip the chicken pieces in the mixture and roll them on the flour until they are perfectly coated. fry the pieces in a pressure cooker if you have one or you can just fry them at 365 degrees f (185° c) ascertained by dropping a 2 inch square of bread, it should turn golden brown in about 60 seconds. in the hot oil fry the chicken pieces for 20 to 30 minutes, occasionally turning them so that they are cooked evenly after the chicken pieces are fried golden brown.

drain the fried chicken for a while on the tissue paper so that it won't be so oily and greasy. serve them hot.","['sage leaf', 'ginger', 'rosemary', 'tomato soup mix', 'sweet marjoram', 'pepper', 'black pepper', 'chicken', 'thyme leaves', 'all-purpose flour', 'garlic salt', 'onion salt', 'eggs', 'milk', 'brown sugar', 'fresh parsley leaves']",16,2.5,2,kfc chicken 396753

my modification to the original was to try using a 9 x 13 pan rather than chilling, rolling out, and cutting into shapes. (who has time for that, except on special occasions?)  however, using a 9 x 13 pan changes the baking time, and the time given is approximate and based on my experience with a convection oven.  i tend to overbake them a bit because i like shortbread very crisp.

i tried to e-mail this idea to the quaker oats company, only to be informed that they weren't interested in ideas from consumers! their loss, i'd say.
these oats are also fine if not toasted, but are less robust in flavor. you can dress them the same way you would mashed potatoes or rice. for those not familiar with thick-cut oats, they cook up drier and much less soupy than do supermarket oats, even at the highest end of the recommended cooking time. feel free to use any sort of broth, including bouillon cubes and powder but make note of my suggestion to dilute it.

it gives a very slight warmth .
halibut is listed but use any fish you like battered.
i have used tilapia.
note: the recipe calls for a 296 ml bottle of ginger beer approx 12 ounces or 1 1/4 cup. do not just toss the whole amount of ginger beer in since flour brands and weather can make flour somewhat unpredictable. lol
i add about 3/4of the amount and then slowly add more until i get a good coating consistency. batter should be slightly runny.
try not to overmix since it can lead to a tough and not crispy coating.
i also dredge the fish in cornstarch instead of flour . can't remember where i read to do this but what a difference.
can also add a dash of chili or cayenne.

sara's discussion includes a very good description of brisket from a butcher's (and consumer's viewpoint) ... you can find similar great informaton in molly stevens' braising book (an iacp and beard foundation prize winner, so well worth having).

the portions are based on a 5.5 lb brisket, 10% shrinkage during cooking and a 6 oz portion serving (10 servings). i often find people go for 8-10 oz, so don't be surprized if this turns into 7-8 servings! btw, as with most braises, it tastes even better the next day -- i often make it a day ahead to let the flavors marry overnight ...

to answer a few basic questions: the strategy here is that we will coat the brisket with a seasoned flour to create a crust and seal in the juices. we will then create a vegetable base (broth) on the stovetop, reduce it to concentrate its flavor, then reliquify it with chicken broth to braise (cook in a relatively small amount of liquid) the brisket to complete tenderness. this sounds complicated, but its really not ... and the layers of flavor are just amazing!! the horseradish sauce is made separately, on the cooktop.

variations: 
(1) skip the horseradish sauce and use the pan sauce. either one is great.

(2) skip the oven and use a slow cooker to do the braising. no fuss and keeps the kitchen cool and the oven clean. you will still need to do a fair amount on the cooktop. each slow cooker has different temperatures, but i'd suggest starting at about 4-6 hours at high heat and using at a minimum a 5 qt cooker.

(3) kosher brisket and kosher wine makes this a kosher main course.

(4) for passover, replace the flour with matzoh meal.","['garlic', 'all-purpose flour', 'kosher salt', 'ground black pepper', 'beef brisket', 'olive oil', 'onions', 'dry red wine', 'tomato paste', 'dried bay leaves', 'dried thyme', 'chicken stock', 'horseradish', 'white wine vinegar', 'mayonnaise', 'fresh chives', 'lemon juice']",17,5.0,1,red wine braised beef brisket w horseradish sauce sara moulton 317813
